           Neerja Bhanot was an Indian model and purser for the airline who gave her life saving passengers on Pan Am Flight 73<br />
           which was hijacked by terrorists during a stopover in Karachi, Pakistan, on 5 September 1986.<br />
           Posthumously, she became the youngest recipient of India's highest peacetime gallantry, the Ashok Chakra Award,<br />
           as well as several other accolades from the government of Pakistan and the United States.<br />
           She was shot while helping passengers escape through the emergency exits.<br />
           Neerja applied for a flight attendant job with Pan Am, when in 1985 it decided to have an all Indian cabin crew for its Frankfurt to India routes.<br />
           Upon selection, she went to Miami, Florida for training as a flight attendant, but returned as a purser.<br />
           She also had a successful modelling career simultaneously during her work at Pan Am. <br />
           Bhanot was the Senior Flight Purser on Pan Am Flight 73 flying from Mumbai to the United States, <br />
           which was hijacked by four armed men on 5 September 1986 at Karachi airport in Pakistan.<br />
           The aircraft was carrying 380 passengers and 13 crew members.<br />
           The terrorists wanted to fly to Cyprus with the goal of freeing Palestinian prisoners in Cyprus.<br />
           The hijackers were targeting Americans and American assets.<br />
           The terrorists then instructed Bhanot to collect the passports of all the passengers so that they could identify the other Americans on board.<br />
           She and the other attendants under her charge hid the passports of the remaining 43 Americans on board;<br />
           some under a seat and the rest down a rubbish chute so that the hijackers could not differentiate between American and non-American passengers.<br />
           After 17 hours, the hijackers opened fire and set off explosives. <br />
           Bhanot opened one of the airplane doors, and started helping the other passengers escape.<br />
           If she wanted, like the other cabin crew on board, she could have been the first one to jump out <br />
           and escape from the aircraft when she opened the door,but she decided not to and instead started helping the other passengers escape.<br />
           According to a surviving passenger, She was guiding the passengers to the emergency exit.<br />
           That is when the terrorists were firing constantly fearing a commando attack.<br />
           She was shot as she covered three small children, who were about to be shot by the hijackers, with her own body. <br />
           She became the youngest recipient of the Ashok Chakra Award. <br />
